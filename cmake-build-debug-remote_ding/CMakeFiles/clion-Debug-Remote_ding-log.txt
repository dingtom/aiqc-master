CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:27 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findbase64.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "base64", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "base64" with any
  of the following names:

    base64Config.cmake
    base64-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "base64" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "base64_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "base64"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
